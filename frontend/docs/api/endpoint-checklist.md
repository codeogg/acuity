# Frontend endpoint checklist — backend to-do

**Generated:** by `packages/api-client/scripts/gen-endpoint-checklist.mjs` (re-run to refresh; do not edit by hand).
**Source:** `packages/types/openapi.json` (the canonical contract) joined with `packages/api-client/src/endpoints/frontend-only.registry.json` (frontend-implementation metadata).
**Parity guarantee:** `packages/api-client/scripts/verify-data-layer.mjs` asserts spec-registry parity plus one typed function and one MSW handler per operation.

Every row is an endpoint the frontend calls. **EXISTS** = implemented by the demo backend; **MISSING** = the frontend needs it and the demo API has no equivalent; **PARTIAL** = backend substrate exists but no usable API; **DRIFT** = overlaps or conflicts with an existing contract op (reconcile with the backend); **FUTURE-AUTH** = spec-target auth-provider journey beyond the demo backend. Contract dialect (full statement in the spec's `info.description` and `docs/api/implementation-notes.md`): snake_case, `{items,total,page,page_size}` list envelope, `{error:{code,message}}` error envelope (messages may be Chinese), JWT bearer / httpOnly `access_token` cookie auth, cross-tenant -> 404 not 403, `row_version` optimistic lock -> 409.

| DRIFT | 2 |

| Status | Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| EXISTS | POST | `/api/doctor/ai/extract` | Extract |

| EXISTS | POST | `/api/doctor/claims/{claim_id}/extract` | Extract Claim |
| EXISTS | PUT | `/api/doctor/claims/{claim_id}/fields` | Update Fields — Request body carries the declared extensions `confirmed` + `row_version` (see FieldsUpdate). The backend should persist per-field confirmation and enforce the optimistic lock (409 on stale row_version) when it lands the claim-level row_version. |
| EXISTS | POST | `/api/doctor/claims/{claim_id}/generate-pdf` | Generate Pdf |

| DRIFT | DELETE | `/api/doctor/claims/{claim_id}` | `deleteClaim` — Intake source text + per-field confirmation set + row-version cursor, and history permanent-delete. Per-field confirmation state has no home in the current contract — the most load-bearing gap to raise. (matrix-app.md §9.10) — New permanent-delete operation, distinct from POST .../cancel; restricted to CANCELLED/DRAFT claims. |
| DRIFT | GET | `/api/doctor/coverage-registry` | `getCoverageRegistry` — Covered-vs-roadmap insurer/form registry driving form selection; coverage must never be overstated. (matrix-app.md §9.7/9.10) — also: site — Kept as a distinct, richer operation (covered-vs-roadmap registry) - not a rename of GET /api/doctor/insurance-companies. |
